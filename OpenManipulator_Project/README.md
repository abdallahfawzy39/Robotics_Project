This is my Robotics course project. It is focused on open_manipulator and simulating it on Gazebo. We were using a GUI to help us debug this project also. It has 2 milestones.

Milestone2: Implementing forward to calculate the end effector's position based on joints' angles and inverse kinematics to calculate joints angles based on end effector's goal position.
Milestone3: Grabing a cube and transfering it to another position.
